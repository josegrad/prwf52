<p><strong><br><span class="contributor">Catherine Eagleton, curator, British Museum</span><br></strong></p>
<p>It’s now a couple of months since the last blog post – so much has been going on that we haven’t had time to write anything about it all. Sometimes, when I talk to friends outside the museum sector, they are surprised at how long major exhibition or gallery projects seem to take, but when you’re working on one of these projects, you see the number and range of things that there are to do.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is hoarding up in what will become The Citi Money Gallery, and behind there, the cases have all been emptied, and the walls and ceiling have been repainted. Next, there’s work to do on cabling and other basic infrastructure, before we start to install the new displays. Before the scaffolding came down, I made sure I went up to the top, touched the ceiling, and took this picture.</p>
<div id="attachment_3604" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 554px">
<img class=" wp-image-3604 " title="The view above the hoardings" src="mg_6_ceiling.jpg?w=544&amp;h=354" alt="The view above the hoardings" width="544" height="354"><p class="wp-caption-text">The view above the hoardings</p>
</div>
<p>At the same time, the final work is being done on the design of the gallery, including the layout of objects in the cases, and the text that will go with them. With so many specialist curators involved, each piece of text has to be edited, and checked, and re-checked, to make sure we have every detail right. Then, the text and images all go to our graphic designer to create the panels and labels for the new displays. As I write, we are expecting the first proofs of the panels to arrive, which means that it starts to feel like the new gallery is nearly ready to be installed.</p>
<p>The objects aren’t being neglected either, and the team of Museum Assistants in the Department of Coins and Medals are busy checking all the object lists, and getting all the objects ready for display. This preparation involves every object being individually checked by one of the Museum’s conservation team to make sure it’s in good enough condition to go on permanent display, as well as so they can advise on how objects are mounted. With more than 1000 to check, this is a big job.</p>
<p>It’s amazing sometimes what a gallery curator gets involved with – from paint colour choices to deep discussions about how to ensure consistency in our use of ancient place names, and from climbing scaffolding to talking about whether a plastic object would deteriorate if it was on display for five years. I’ll be talking more about this to the next generation of museum curators at a Museum Studies day in March, which I’m very excited about.</p>

<p>Mary Shepperson and I found three small clay figurines in house E13.6, some of the few anthropomorphic representations found at Amara West.</p>

<p>Although incomplete, the three figurines have the same rectangular shape and a fine polished surface. They each depict a naked woman, in a very schematic form, with only the breasts and a pubic triangle shown in detail. The breasts are usually added as separate pieces of clay, and thus easily break off, as with two of our examples. The pubic triangle was marked with a series of small holes. None feature legs or arms.</p>

<p>Such representations are well known in ancient Egypt, especially from the Middle Kingdom onwards. By emphasing the genitalia, they evoke the woman as a source of fertility and thus could be associated with the cult of the goddess Hathor.</p>
<p>Some similar statuettes were found in Upper Egypt, placed in the temple of Deir el-Bahri during the New Kingdom. Other more elaborate types of fertility figurine, in painted wood, are known from late Middle Kingdom tombs.</p>

<p><strong><br><span class="contributor">Philip Kevin, British Museum</span><br></strong></p>
<p>Many objects discovered in the cemetery at Amara West require conservation to even allow them to be lifted, as they cannot support their own weight without consolidation.</p>
<p>This is particularly true with organic material, which tends to be poorly preserved in the burial conditions here. In addition to natural degradation through desiccation and the effects of termites, disturbance by looters (ancient and modern) has left objects in a very fragile condition.</p>
<div id="attachment_3479" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 554px">
<img class=" wp-image-3479 " title="Tools of the trade: consolidating fragile organic remains" src="aw_2012-30_blower.jpg?w=544&amp;h=362" alt="Tools of the trade: consolidating fragile organic remains" width="544" height="362"><p class="wp-caption-text">Tools of the trade: consolidating fragile organic remains</p>
</div>
<p>The roofs of the burial chambers were often collapsed as looters entered to gain access to grave contents. The resulting fall of sharp schist gravel ripped through and crushed much of what lay below, including the coffin found in grave G309. Careful excavations by Åshild Vågene revealed traces of wood and plaster.</p>
<div id="attachment_3480" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 314px">
<img class="size-full wp-image-3480" title="Tight working conditions: preparing to lift the bed in G314" src="aw_2012-30_working.jpg?w=418" alt="Tight working conditions: preparing to lift the bed in G314"><p class="wp-caption-text">Tight working conditions: preparing to lift the bed in G314</p>
</div>
<p>These coffins are constructed from wood onto which a thin layer of plaster is applied to all surfaces; this is then painted, and in some cases varnished with a plant resin. Our two coffin fragments (of 20cm by 10cm) had only tiny traces of the internal plaster remaining, but pieces of crumbly wood were still in place. The outer plaster skin has survived in better condition, and is painted.</p>
<p>In order to impart some strength to allow the pieces to be lifted, I started by strengthening the wood and plaster with a mixture of solvent and a synthetic adhesive. It was impossible to remove the fine sand and soil without losing original wood and plaster; even using a small blower would cause some plaster to disappear in a cloud of white dust.</p>
<p>Having consolidated the wood and plaster, an additional support was attached to the back (inside of the coffin) and the fragments were then lifted and returned to the expedition house where they await further treatment.</p>
<p>In another grave being excavated by Laurel Engbring and Michaela Binder, fragments of a Nubian-style funerary bed and a basket were revealed, and I treated them in a similar manner before lifting. A fragment of textile (approximately 10cm2) was also conserved in this grave, offering a rare chance to study the weaving technique used.</p>
<p>This is my first time in Sudan, and it has been fantastic – except when I missed my step clambering out of the boat in the 6.30am darkness, and ended up in the Nile.</p>

<p>I spent the end of the season excavating a chamber tomb, Grave 319. The tomb features a two metre-wide burial chamber on the western side of a shaft cut into the alluvial surface; no above ground architecture is preserved.</p>

</div>
<p>On the east side, we found the top of a doorway to another chamber, but this proved to be only 10 cm deep – for some reason plans to cut an eastern chamber were never completed. Some very large schist slabs found lying in the shaft must once have covered the grave.</p>

</div>
<p>As often at Amara West, these heavy stones did not protect this grave from looting in ancient times. Nevertheless, we recovered the skeletal remains of four individuals within the sandy deposit inside the western chamber.</p>
<p>Remnants of the funerary equipment buried with the deceased individuals indicated the range of original burial goods: pieces of wood and painted plaster (showing at least one individual was buried in a decorated coffin), ostrich egg shell, an Egyptian-style beer jar and a fragment of a wooden headrest.</p>
<p>Standing out among this material was the bright blue of a glazed scarab, bearing the inscription: ‘Ramesses, beloved of Amun-Ra and Ra-Horakhty, born of the gods, who founded the Two Lands’.</p>
<p>While this inscription mentions Ramesses II, the scarab might have been made after his long reign. Furthermore, we will never know which of the four individuals was buried with the scarab.</p>

<p>The houses at Amara West can look a little drab to the modern eye: brown mud walls, often with brown mud plaster and even brown clay floors. We are missing the wooden furniture and any textiles that might have broken this monotony, but it is also clear that some parts of houses were brightly painted.</p>
<p>British Museum conservator Philip Kevin has been studying and conserving fragments of painted plaster on mud from Mat Dalton’s excavations in house E13.7 last year. After removing a rather dull white plaster layer from one fragment (F5133d), we can now see that earlier decoration featured yellow, blue, red and black.</p>
<div id="attachment_3562" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 554px">
<img class=" wp-image-3562 " title="Painted decoration from house E13.7" src="aw_2012-34_plaster1.jpg?w=544&amp;h=386" alt="Painted decoration from house E13.7" width="544" height="386"><p class="wp-caption-text">Painted decoration from house E13.7</p>
</div>
<p>It seems to consist of a yellow area bordered with a black line, and a more complex decorative motif to the right, which might have framed a door, or the shrine we believe was located in this room.</p>
<div id="attachment_3563" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 554px">
<img class=" wp-image-3563 " title="The same fragment, before removal of the white layer" src="aw_2012-34_plaster2.jpg?w=544&amp;h=363" alt="The same fragment, before removal of the white layer" width="544" height="363"><p class="wp-caption-text">The same fragment, before removal of the white layer</p>
</div>
<p>Further fragments will hopefully reveal more of the room’s original decoration, and the discovery of areas where pigments might have been prepared provides potential for further avenues of research.</p>

<p>Five weeks ago, Mary Shepperson revealed the remains of a stone doorway, tumbled into room two of house E13.6. Over the last few days we have reconstructed the gateway in the courtyard of our house – albeit laid flat on the ground rather than vertical…</p>
<div id="attachment_3530" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 314px">

</div>
<p>The imposing appearance of the doorway is now more evident, standing 2.35m tall, with a passageway of 88cm wide by 1.75m tall. In terms of scale, many of our field team would have to stoop to walk through the door. </p>
<p>The lintel is made from an unusually fine sandstone – perhaps from Sai island – whereas the doorjambs are of the poor quality sandstone we more often encounter. This doorway would have been set into the mudbrick wall.</p>
<p>The jambs are not inscribed – any inscription would have been into a layer of white plaster, now largely disappeared. On the lintel, the red- and yellow-painted hieroglyphs invoke the god Amun-Ra and Horus Lord of Ta-sety, and also refer to king Tuthmosis III. </p>

</div>
<p>Interestingly, this door was not the main house door, but rather framed the entrance to the central reception room, with a low bench against its back wall. As such it may have marked the transition from more prosaic spaces at the front of the house, towards a more formal space which could be used for welcoming visitors. </p>
<p>Beyond lay two more rooms – presumably the most private areas of the house.</p>
<p>A doorway in an adjacent and contemporary house (E13.9), excavated in 2009, simply lined with mud plaster and with unworked schist slabs for a lintel and threshold, shows how simple internal house doors could be at Amara West.</p>

<p>As work on the Chiseldon Iron Age cauldrons progresses we are constantly making discoveries. Possibly the most exciting feature we have found so far is a decorated handle.</p>
<p>The decorated handle and section of rim came from a cauldron that had broken into several pieces during burial due to the weight of the overlying soil. Although we had used X-radiography to examine the handle fragment in its soil block before we began conservation, it was difficult to make out the surface due to the dense soil and corroded condition of the metal. This meant that when I was removing the soil I had to progress extremely slowly. However, it made discovering the decoration below especially exciting.</p>

<img class=" wp-image-3507 " title="X-radiograph of the handle before conservation" src="cc_9_x-ray.jpg?w=544&amp;h=438" alt="X-radiograph of the handle before conservation" width="544" height="438"><p class="wp-caption-text">X-radiograph of the handle before conservation</p>
</div>
<p>The decoration consists of three curved plates that have been riveted below the rim on either side of and directly beneath the handle. The additional plates were carefully made and are likely not only to have been decorative, but also served to strengthen the point where the handle is attached.</p>
<div id="attachment_3506" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 554px">

</div>
<p>While the plates could represent abstract decoration they strongly resemble a cow’s head, with the side-plates representing ears, the central plate a muzzle and the handle taking the form of boldly curved horns. Stylised decoration inspired by the shape of animals was not uncommon in the Iron Age and its association with feasting in this context is particularly relevant. However, decoration on cauldrons is extremely rare and this is a significant and exciting discovery.</p>

</div>
<p>To help with the interpretation Stephen Crummy, an illustrator from the Department of Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum, has been scanning the decorated handle with a laser to make a three-dimensional image which will show its shape far more accurately and aid in creating a virtual reconstruction of the vessel.</p>

<p>Up in Cemetery D at Amara West it’s getting increasingly busy as we look towards the last week of excavation. For the last few days I’ve been working with Laurel Engbring on G314 – which has turned out to be one of the most important discoveries this year, with two burial chambers underneath a tumulus superstructure.</p>
<div id="attachment_3452" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 554px">
<img class=" wp-image-3452 " title="Laurel recovering a large vessel from the western chamber in G314" src="aw_2012-29_pottery.jpg?w=544&amp;h=362" alt="Laurel recovering a large vessel from the western chamber in G314" width="544" height="362"><p class="wp-caption-text">Laurel recovering a large vessel from the western chamber in G314</p>
</div>
<p>The large amount of schist slabs covering and blocking the narrow shaft may have prevented the thorough looting (ancient and modern) we often encounter in Cemetery D. Therefore, both chambers provide us with a glimpse into burial customs and cultural expression in the time period after the Egyptian occupation of Amara West, from around 1000 BC onwards. Preservation of organic materials and human remains is also excellent in this grave.</p>
<div id="attachment_3453" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 314px">
<img class="size-full wp-image-3453" title="3,000 years of bed-making – ancient fragment from G314 (left), modern example (right)." src="aw_2012-29_wood.jpg?w=418" alt="3,000 years of bed-making – ancient fragment from G314 (left), modern example (right)."><p class="wp-caption-text">3,000 years of bed-making – ancient fragment <br>from G314 (left), modern example (right).</p>
</div>
<p>In the western chamber we have revealed one wooden burial bed, and there may be one beneath it. Seven individuals were buried in this small chamber (five metres-square), including adults and children – lying over each other in a rather confusing manner.</p>
<p>The burial positions changed over the period during which the grave was used: the uppermost were buried in a Nubian manner, tightly flexed, whereas the bodies underneath were buried in an extended position, typical of burials in Egypt. A third extended burial has just been found in the entrance area to the western chamber. </p>
<p>What the motivations were for laying out the bodies in this way is difficult to say.</p>
<p>The pottery assemblage from this tomb includes vessel types so far unknown at Amara West, suggesting the development of a local tradition in which Egyptian vessel forms were taken and modified to suit local tastes.</p>
<p>And of course there’s plenty of interesting details for the physical anthropologist. Just yesterday, Laurel recovered an individual with a healed fracture of the sacrum (a large bone at the base of the spine) and a lumbar vertebrae – indications of what must have been an incredibly painful fall on the individual’s backside…</p>
